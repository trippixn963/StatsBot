# Discord Webhook Logging Feature Requirements

## Introduction

This feature adds comprehensive Discord webhook logging capabilities to StatsBot, enabling real-time monitoring of bot operations, errors, performance metrics, and system events directly within Discord channels.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Webhook Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a bot administrator, I want to configure multiple webhook endpoints for different types of logs, so that I can organize monitoring across different Discord channels.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the bot starts THEN it SHALL load webhook configurations from environment variables
2. WHEN multiple webhook URLs are provided THEN the system SHALL support different webhooks for different log levels
3. IF a webhook URL is invalid THEN the system SHALL log an error and continue without webhook logging
4. WHEN webhook configuration changes THEN the system SHALL reload configurations without restart

### Requirement 2: Structured Log Message Formatting

**User Story:** As a server moderator, I want to receive well-formatted log messages with relevant context, so that I can quickly understand what's happening with the bot.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a log event occurs THEN the webhook message SHALL include timestamp, log level, and source component
2. WHEN an error occurs THEN the message SHALL include error details, stack trace (if available), and context
3. WHEN performance metrics are logged THEN the message SHALL include formatted metrics with visual indicators
4. WHEN member events occur THEN the message SHALL include member information and event type

### Requirement 3: Log Level Filtering and Routing

**User Story:** As a bot administrator, I want to route different log levels to different channels, so that I can separate critical alerts from general information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring webhooks THEN each webhook SHALL support minimum log level filtering
2. WHEN a log event occurs THEN it SHALL only be sent to webhooks configured for that log level or lower
3. WHEN critical errors occur THEN they SHALL be sent to all configured error webhooks regardless of other filters
4. WHEN debug logs are generated THEN they SHALL only be sent if explicitly enabled for that webhook

### Requirement 4: Rate Limiting and Batching

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want webhook messages to be rate-limited and batched, so that Discord's API limits are respected and channels aren't flooded.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple log events occur rapidly THEN the system SHALL batch them into single webhook messages
2. WHEN Discord rate limits are approached THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff
3. WHEN webhook delivery fails THEN the system SHALL retry with increasing delays up to a maximum
4. WHEN the batch size limit is reached THEN the system SHALL send the batch immediately

### Requirement 5: Performance and System Monitoring

**User Story:** As a bot administrator, I want to receive automated alerts about bot performance and system health, so that I can proactively address issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN memory usage exceeds thresholds THEN the system SHALL send formatted alerts to monitoring webhooks
2. WHEN slow operations are detected THEN the system SHALL send performance warnings
3. WHEN the bot connects/disconnects THEN the system SHALL send status updates
4. WHEN daily statistics are generated THEN the system SHALL send summary reports

### Requirement 6: Error Handling and Fallback

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the webhook logging system to be resilient, so that webhook failures don't affect bot operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN webhook delivery fails THEN the system SHALL continue normal operations without interruption
2. WHEN all webhooks are unavailable THEN the system SHALL fall back to file logging only
3. WHEN webhook errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged to local files but not sent to webhooks (to prevent loops)
4. WHEN webhook service is restored THEN the system SHALL resume webhook logging automatically

### Requirement 7: Security and Privacy

**User Story:** As a server owner, I want sensitive information to be filtered from webhook logs, so that private data isn't exposed in Discord channels.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN logging user events THEN personal information SHALL be masked or excluded based on configuration
2. WHEN logging API tokens or secrets THEN they SHALL be completely redacted from webhook messages
3. WHEN logging member data THEN only necessary information SHALL be included based on privacy settings
4. WHEN webhook URLs contain sensitive data THEN they SHALL be stored securely and not logged

### Requirement 8: Customizable Message Templates

**User Story:** As a bot administrator, I want to customize webhook message formats, so that they match my server's style and information needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring webhooks THEN custom message templates SHALL be supported
2. WHEN using templates THEN variable substitution SHALL be available for dynamic content
3. WHEN templates are invalid THEN the system SHALL fall back to default formatting
4. WHEN embed formatting is enabled THEN rich Discord embeds SHALL be used instead of plain text
